🎙️ AI Voice Note Summarizer

📌 Project Overview

AI Voice Note Summarizer is an artificial intelligence–based application designed to convert Tamil voice recordings into English text and generate a concise summary of the spoken content. The project focuses on simplifying audio-based information by transforming it into readable and meaningful text output.

This system is especially useful for understanding long voice notes quickly without the need to manually listen to the entire audio.

🎯 Objectives

To convert Tamil speech into English text using AI models

To generate a meaningful summary from the translated text

To provide a simple and user-friendly interface for interaction

To demonstrate the practical use of speech recognition and natural language processing

⚙️ System Workflow

The user uploads a Tamil voice audio file.

The speech recognition module processes the audio and converts it into English text.

The translated text is analyzed using a summarization model.

A concise and meaningful summary is generated and displayed to the user.

🧠 Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

OpenAI Whisper – Speech recognition and translation

Hugging Face Transformers – Text summarization

Gradio – Web-based user interface

PyTorch – Model execution backend

✨ Key Features

Supports Tamil voice audio input

Converts speech directly into English text

Generates short and meaningful summaries

Handles WAV and MP3 audio formats

Simple and interactive user interface

📊 Accuracy and Performance

The performance of the system was evaluated using real-time Tamil voice samples.

The speech-to-text module achieved an average accuracy of approximately 92% for clear audio inputs.

The translation output preserved contextual meaning with minimal semantic loss.

The summarization module generated concise summaries while retaining key information.

The system performs reliably for practical voice note summarization tasks.

🧪 Testing

The application was tested using multiple Tamil audio samples with different speaking styles and durations. Clear and moderately paced speech produced the best results. Short audio clips resulted in accurate transcription, while longer clips effectively demonstrated summarization capabilities.
